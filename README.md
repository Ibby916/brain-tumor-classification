# Brain Tumor Classification using MRI Scans

This project uses the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset provided by [Sartaj Bhuvaji on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri). It focuses on classifying brain tumors into four distinct categories: no tumor, pituitary tumor, meningioma tumor, and glioma tumor. To achieve this, four different deep learning models were developed and compared. The goal was to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to support medical professionals by providing an automated and accurate classification system, potentially saving time and improving diagnostic reliability.

## Dataset Description
The **Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)** dataset consists of MRI images categorized into four classes:

- No Tumor: 500 images

- Pituitary Tumor: 901 images

- Meningioma Tumor: 937 images

- Glioma Tumor: 926 images

The dataset contains 3,264 images in total, presenting a challenging classification task due to the variability in tumor appearance and location
